<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! 👋 My name is Amare Gesso, and I’m a passionate web developer with a knack for creating intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites. With 2 years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in building responsive and accessible web applications that deliver seamless user experiences.

  I’m proficient in a range of modern web technologies, including:
  
  Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Vue.js
  Backend: Node.js, Express, Django
  Tools & Frameworks: Git, Webpack, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap</p>

<p>I thrive on solving complex problems through code and am driven by the desire to turn ideas into digital realities. Whether it’s crafting clean, maintainable code or collaborating with clients and teams to bring projects to life, I’m always up for a challenge.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you can find me “exploring nature trails,” “playing guitar,” or “trying out new coffee blends”.

  Feel free to explore my portfolio, where you’ll find examples of my work, ranging from dynamic single-page applications to robust e-commerce platforms.
  
  Let’s connect and create something awesome together! 🚀.</p>
